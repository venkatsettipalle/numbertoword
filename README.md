# The Number names

Show how to spell out a number in English.

You can use a pre existing implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less).

Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers) is optional. 


## The brief

We have created a number of acceptance tests for the Number names and your challenge is to get them passing. Additionally, please make sure your solution is accompanied by comments in any form that describe a step-by-step refactorings, so we can understand the way you were thinking.

## Some hints
Write your code in NumberNamesImpl.java, you can make other classes. But make sure they are called from NumberNamesImpl.java only.
You can check NumberNamesFixture.java file to write test cases. You can uncomment this file and implement your test cases.
If you are new to Gradle, it may be worth spending 10 minutes reading a high level summary.  We are using the Gradle
Wrapper so `gradlew` from the command line should download everything you need.  Most modern IDEs support Gradle projects.

The use of JBehave in this instance is to provide you with our definition of done for the task.
